# Task 14 - a function calculating the hypotenuse c of a right-angled triangle and the angle it creates with side b (in degrees)
Task 15 - a function calculating the area and circumference of a circle. The function takes the radius of the circle as input parameter
Task 16:
     a - the graph of a certain function in a given interval
     b - a new graph containing the graph of the function from task 14a and the graph of the function 𝑦 = sin(𝑥∙𝜋)/2.
     c,d,f - modifications
Task 17 - three graphs in one window
Task 19 - the sine and cosine functions for 𝑥𝜖〈−3; 3〉 on two subplots
Task 21 - a linear 3D graph of a function
Task 22 - a 3D graph of the function 𝑧 = 𝑒^(−𝑥^2−𝑦^2). The grid covers the range <-2; 2> with a step of 0.1
Task 23 - creating 3D figures using a script
Task 24 - a function that takes two numbers a and b and then displays the message 'Number a is smaller', 'Number b is smaller' or 'Numbers are equal'.
Task 25 - a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. It has been supplemented with input data control, i.e., if one of the sides is negative, the calculations will not be performed, and the result returned will be 0.
Task 26 - a function that, based on the values of coefficients a, b, and c, determines how many real roots the equation ax^2+bx+c has and gives their values.
Task 27 - a function that displays the name of the day of the week for the number of the day entered by the user. For days 6 and 7, it should display "weekend," and for numbers outside the range 1-7, it should display information that the week has 7 days.
Task 28 - a function that displays a menu with three buttons: 'sine graph', 'cosine graph', and 'end.' Then, based on the user's choice, it displays the appropriate graph. If the 'end' button is selected, it displays the text message "End selected."
Task 32, 33 - a function that generates a square matrix M of a given size (input parameter of the function).
Task 44 - reading data from a file and displaying it on a graph.
Task 45 - reading data from a file: calculating the average, minimum, and maximum values, as well as the standard deviation and the effective value for signals in columns 2 and 3.
Task 46:
     a - reading data from a file: finding the positions of elements with values >0.7 in exercises 44 and 45, columns 2 and 3.
     b - in column 2, replace all values >0.2 with a value of 0.3. Plot the data before and after the change
